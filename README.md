# Nyanmini-OS
tried making an OS with Gemini(but cute)

to build and run this OS, execute ./run.sh in terminal(assuming you have all the necessary tools installed)
on windows you might wanna install WSL to run it

todo:
+ expand on BASIC clone features: POKE to change the pixel at x, y character/bacground color/foreground color. implement actual IF logic statements, maybe implement BASIC function declaration?
+ look into compiling basic into executables or a an executable type, may need to implement a x86 compiler(might lose sanity doing this so it could never come tbh)
+ are there any bugs? i dont know, and i really dont want to know
